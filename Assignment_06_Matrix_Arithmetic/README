#Description
This assignment practices basic matrix operations in R, creating diagonal matrices, and constructing a custom block-structured 5×5 matrix.

#How to Run
	1. Open 'Assignment 6-Matrix Arithmetic.R' in RStudio.
	2. Run the code line by line or source the script.
	3. Check the outputs:
    -  A + B and A - B show elementwise matrix arithmetic.
		-  diag(c(4,1,2,3)) creates a 4×4 diagonal matrix.
    -  The custom 5×5 matrix is built by combining a column vector with a diagonal block to match the required structure.
