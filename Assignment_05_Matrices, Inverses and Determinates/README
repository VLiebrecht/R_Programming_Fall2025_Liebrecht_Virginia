# Assignment 5- Matrices, Inverses, and Determinants

#Description
This assignment practices creating and inspecting in R, computing inverses and determinants and handling errors for singular or non-square matrices

#How to Run
1. Open 'Assignment5_Matrices.R' in RStudio
2. Run the code line by line or source the script.
3. Check the outputs:
- A is 10x10 but singular (determinant is 0)
- B is 10x100 (non-square, so inverse and determinant are undefined)
