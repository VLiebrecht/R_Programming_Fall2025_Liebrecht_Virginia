# Assignment 7- S3 & S4 Objects

#Description
This assignment explores S3 and S4 objects in R, covering how to create them, inspect their structures, and understand how generic functions dispatch methods differently across systems. 

#How to Run
1. Open Module 7 Assignment in RStudio
2. Run the code line by line
3. Check the outputs:
  - Dataset PopStars_Data is created and inspected through head (), str() and summary ()
  - An S3 object (popstar_s3) is created using a list and assigned a class attribute
  - An S4 Class (popstar_s4) is formally defined with setClass() and instantiated with new()
